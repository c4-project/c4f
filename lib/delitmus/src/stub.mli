(** Producer of 'stub' Litmus tests, which call into an implementation.

    The idea of this module is to facilitate test set-ups with harness
    generators such as Litmus that inline the thread bodies given to them; to
    hide things like return statements and untracked variables from those
    generators, we can delitmusify the thread bodies into a C file, produce a
    stub test with this module, and link the bodies into the generated
    harness. *)
