(** {2 Base definitions}

    These definitions appear here and not inside their respective submodules
    to break mutually recursive dependencies. Generally, you'll want to use
    the submodules instead. *)

    statement. *)

  | In_block of 'a  (** Path passes into the block itself. *)
  | This_cond

          This path, naturally, only makes sense on if statements, or flow
          blocks with a conditional. *)

      (** Path passes through the given branch of an if statement. *)

(** A path focusing on a list of statements. *)

(** {2 Submodules}

    These submodules expose a nicer interface over the recursive types above,
    and also provide paths at the thread and program level. *)

(** A path focusing on an if statement. *)
module If : sig
  type t = (branch * stm_list) flow_block [@@deriving compare, equal]

  (** {3 Constructors} *)

  val in_branch : branch -> stm_list -> t
  (** [this_cond b rest] focuses on the branch of an if statement given by
      [b], using subpath [rest]. *)

  val this_cond : t
  (** [this_cond] focuses on the conditional of an if statement. *)
end

(** A path focusing on a flow block. *)
module Flow : sig
  type t = stm_list flow_block [@@deriving compare, equal]

  (** {3 Constructors} *)

  val in_body : stm_list -> t
  (** [in_body rest] focuses on the body of a while loop using subpath
      [rest]. *)

  val this_cond : t
  (** [this_cond] focuses on the conditional of an if statement. *)
end

module Stm : sig
  type t = stm [@@deriving compare, equal]

  (** {3 Constructors} *)

  val in_if : If.t -> t
  (** [in_if rest] focuses on an if statement using subpath [rest]. *)

  val in_flow : Flow.t -> t
  (** [in_flow rest] focuses on a flow block using subpath [rest]. *)

  val this_stm : t
  (** [this_stm] focuses on a statement as a whole. *)

  (** {3 Accessors and getters} *)

  val index : ('i, index, t, [< field]) Accessor.t
  (** [index] focuses on the index of a statement-list path fragment. *)

  val span : t -> Utils.My_list.Span.t
  (** [span p] gets the span of statements accessed by [p]. *)

  val len : t -> int
  (** [len p] gets the number of statements accessed by [p]. *)

  val is_nested : t -> bool
  (** [is_nested p] gets whether [p] accesses nested paths. *)

  (** {3 Constructors} *)

  val insert : index -> t
  (** [insert index] focuses on inserting a new statement at index [index] of
      a statement list. *)

  val in_stm : index -> Stm.t -> t
  (** [in_stm index rest] focuses on an existing statement at index [index]
      of a statement list, using subpath [rest]. *)

  val stm : index -> t
  (** [stm index] is shorthand for [in_stm index Stm.this_stm]. *)

  (* TODO(@MattWindsor91): spans *)

  val on_range : index -> length -> t
  (** [on_range index length] focuses on an [length]-wide slice of a
      statement list starting at [index]. [length] may be 0, in which case
      the path targets the space just before any statement at [index];
      consequently, [on_range (List.length stms) 0] is a valid path. *)

  val between : index -> index -> t
  (** [between x y] is [on_range x (y-x)], ie the range starting at [x] and
      ending just before [y]. *)

  val singleton : index -> t
  (** [singleton x] is [on_range x 1], ie a range containing just one item. *)

(** A path focusing on a single thread. *)
module Thread : sig
  type t = In_stms of stm_list [@@deriving compare, equal]

  (** {3 Constructors} *)

  val in_stms : stm_list -> t

(** {2 Complete paths} *)

(** A path focusing on a whole subject. *)
type t = In_thread of index * Thread.t [@@deriving sexp, compare, equal]

include Pretty_printer.S with type t := t

(** {3 Constructors} *)

val in_thread : index -> Thread.t -> t

(** {3 Accessors} *)

val tid : t -> int
(** [tid] gets the thread ID of a program path. *)

(** {1 Paths with metadata}

    Most code that manipulates paths does so in the context of the metadata
    that was produced by the path consumer. This lets payload generators help
    themselves to facts about the path site that were available at generation
    time.

    This module is just a specialised form of {!Path_meta.With_meta}; the
    latter exists to help us carry through metadata on incomplete paths. *)
module With_meta : sig
  (** A type synonym for complete paths with metadata. *)
  type nonrec t = t Path_meta.With_meta.t [@@deriving sexp, compare, equal]

  include Pretty_printer.S with type t := t

  val flag : Path_meta.Flag.t -> ('i, bool, t, [< field]) Accessor.t
  (** [flag f] accesses whether [f] is set in this path's metadata. *)
end
