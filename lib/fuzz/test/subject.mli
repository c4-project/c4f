(** Tests and test data for the fuzzer subject representation. *)

(** {1 Test data}

    An example Litmus test, partitioned into lazily evaluated subcomponents. *)
module Test_data : sig
  val body_stms : C4f_fuzz.Subject.Statement.t list Lazy.t
  (** [body_stms] evaluates to the body statements of the example test. *)

  (** For an initial state, use {!State.Test_data}. *)

  val test : C4f_fuzz.Subject.Test.t Lazy.t
  (** [test] evaluates to a sample test subject. *)

  (** {2 Paths that select parts of the example test} *)

  module Path : sig
    (** {3 Path stubs} *)

    val thread_0_stms : C4f_fuzz.Path.Stms.t -> C4f_fuzz.Path.t Lazy.t
    (** [thread_0_stms rest] constructs a path that visits the statements of
        test thread 0. *)

    val known_true_if : C4f_fuzz.Path.If.t -> C4f_fuzz.Path.t Lazy.t
    (** [known_true_if rest] constructs a path that visits an if statement
        with a known-true conditional. *)

    val known_false_if : C4f_fuzz.Path.If.t -> C4f_fuzz.Path.t Lazy.t
    (** [known_false_if rest] constructs a path that visits an if statement
        with a known-false conditional. *)

    val dead_else : C4f_fuzz.Path.Stms.t -> C4f_fuzz.Path.t Lazy.t
    (** [dead_else rest] constructs a path that visits a dead 'else' leg of
        an if statement. *)

    (** {3 Statement paths} *)

    val in_stm : C4f_fuzz.Path.t Lazy.t
    (** [in_stm] is a full path that points to an arbitrary primitive
        statement. *)

    (** [insert_once_loop_end] is a full path that points to the end of a
        one-execution loop for insertion purposes. *)

    (** [insert_multi_loop_end] is a full path that points to the end of a
        multi-execution loop for insertion purposes. *)

    val insert_dead : C4f_fuzz.Path.With_meta.t Lazy.t
    (** [insert_dead] is a full path that points to somewhere in dead code
        that can take statement insertions, but is not in a loop. *)

    val insert_dead_loop : C4f_fuzz.Path.With_meta.t Lazy.t
    (** [insert_dead_loop] is a full path that points to somewhere in dead
        code that can take statement insertions, and is in a loop. *)

    val insert_live : C4f_fuzz.Path.With_meta.t Lazy.t
    (** [insert_live] is a full path that points to somewhere in live code
        that can take statement insertions. *)

    val insert_start : C4f_fuzz.Path.With_meta.t Lazy.t
    (** [insert_start] is a full path that points to the start of a block of
        live code, for statement insertions. *)

    val insert_end : C4f_fuzz.Path.With_meta.t Lazy.t
    (** [insert_end] is a full path that points to the end of a block of live
        code, for statement insertions. *)

    val surround_atomic : C4f_fuzz.Path.With_meta.t Lazy.t
    (** [surround_atomic] is a full path that points to a statement range
        containing atomics, ready for surrounding. *)

        inside dead-code, ready for surrounding. *)

    val surround_txsafe : C4f_fuzz.Path.With_meta.t Lazy.t
    (** [surround_txsafe] is a full path that points to a statement range
        containing only transaction-safe statements (if any), ready for
        surrounding. *)

    val surround_label_direct : C4f_fuzz.Path.With_meta.t Lazy.t
    (** [surround_label_direct] is a full path that points to a statement
        range directly containing labels. *)
