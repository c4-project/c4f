(** Known-output operator expression generation

    This module is a layer on top of the algebraic rules information about
    operators (see {!Op}, {!Op_rules}, and {!Op_types}), and provides generic
    functions for generating operations on expressions with specific output
    properties. *)

(** {1 Operand sets}

    We can generate a known-output operand expression with various types of
    input operands:

    - one expression (reflexive operations get that expression on both
      sides);
    - two equivalent expressions (reflexive operations get each expression
      but in a random order; and use-with-constant expressions get one of the
      two expressions at random).

    The {!Operand_set} module holds the type used to feed these operands into
    the generator. We assume a higher-level generator has already generated
    the expressions. *)

module Operand_set : sig
  type t =
    | One of Fir.Expression.t
    | Two of Fir.Expression.t * Fir.Expression.t
        (** Type of operand sets. *)
end

val basic_lift_k : Fir.Constant.t -> Fir.Expression.t Q.Generator.t
(** [basic_lift_k k] lifts constants into singleton expression generators. *)

(** Type of partially applied bop generators. *)
type bop_gen =
     (Fir.Constant.t -> Fir.Expression.t Q.Generator.t)
  -> Operand_set.t
  -> Fir.Expression.t Q.Generator.t

val bop_with_output :
  ?ops:Fir.Op.Binary.t list -> Fir.Op_rule.Out.t -> bop_gen option
(** [bop_with_output ?ops ~out] tries to produce a generator generating a
    binary operation from [ops] (defaulting to all operators) such that the
    output is guaranteed to match output rule [out]; it returns [None] if
    there are no viable operators. The returned generator should provide an
    operand set and lifting generator for any constants involved in the rule. *)
