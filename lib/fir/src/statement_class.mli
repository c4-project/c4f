(** Classifying statements.

    This module provides several functions and enumerations for checking the
    'class' of a statement. These are useful for, for instance, constructing
    path filters that must terminate in specific statements.

    (The name 'class' nods to the fact that, were ACT implemented in an
    object oriented language, these enumerations would literally be the class
    hierarchy of the statement type system.

    New classes will be added as and when other parts of ACT depend on them.
    To allow this to happen smoothly, the various [classify] functions can
    choose to return [None] when asked for specific information. *)
