(** Expression traversal.

    All traversal has to be done centrally for expressions, because OCaml
    gets very persnickety (and not very helpful) when it comes to mutually
    recursive functors. *)

    These mainly abstract over the traversals above, for now. *)

(** [depended_upon_idents] recursively gets every identifier in an expression
    that said expression is considered to depend upon. Over time, the notion
    of dependence may weaken, and this getter may pull in a subset of the
    identifiers mentioned in the expression. *)
