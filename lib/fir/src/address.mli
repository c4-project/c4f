(** {1 Constructors} *)

val ref_lvalue : Lvalue.t -> t
(** [ref_lvalue lv] constructs a &-reference to [lv]. If [lv] is already a
    dereference, it strips one layer of dereferencing instead of creating a
    new layer of indirection. *)

val ref_normal : t -> t
(** [ref_normal t] constructs a &-reference to [t], but uses {{!ref_lvalue}
    ref_lvalue} if [t] is an lvalue. *)

val normalise : t -> t
(** [normalise addr] reconstructs [addr], using {{!ref_normal} ref_normal}
    for every layer of indirection.

    Note that this operation can remove information about which operations
    are safe to perform on an address. For example, `&*foo` implies that
    `foo` is a pointer type (and therefore `*foo` is valid): normalisation
    will reduce it to `foo`, which doesn't. *)

val deref : t -> t
(** [deref addr] tries to strip a level of reference from [addr]. If the
    normalised form of [addr] is an lvalue, it returns the result of directly
    dereferencing from that lvalue instead. *)

val of_variable_str_exn : string -> t
(** [of_variable_str_exn vs] is shorthand for applying {!of_variable} to the
    result of converting [vs] from a string to a C identifier. It will fail
    with an exception if [vs] is not a valid C identifier, and so this
    function should not be used on user-input data. *)

(** {1 Accessors and various traversals} *)

val reduce : t -> lvalue:(Lvalue.t -> 'a) -> ref:('a -> 'a) -> 'a
(** [reduce addr ~address ~deref] applies [lvalue] on the underlying lvalue
    of [addr], then recursively applies [ref] to the result for each layer of
    address-taking in the address. *)

val lvalue_of : ('i, Lvalue.t, t, [< field]) Accessor.t

(** We can get to the variable name inside an address. *)

(** {2 Variable accessors} *)

val variable : ('i, Common.C_id.t, t, [< variant]) Accessor.t
(** [variable] focuses on addresses that are just variable lvalues. *)

val variable_ref : ('i, Common.C_id.t, t, [< variant]) Accessor.t
(** [variable_ref] focuses on addresses that are references to variable
    lvalues. *)

(** {1 Safe accessors}

    These accessors return an error if the address isn't in the right shape. *)

val as_lvalue : t -> Lvalue.t Or_error.t
(** [as_lvalue addr] normalises [addr], then returns it as an {{!Lvalue.t}
    lvalue} if it is one, or an error otherwise. *)

val as_variable : t -> Common.C_id.t Or_error.t
(** [as_variable addr] normalises [addr], then returns it as a variable ID if
    it is one, or an error otherwise. *)

(** {1 Type-checking} *)

(** Type-checking for addresses. *)
include Types.S_type_checkable with type t := t

(** {1 Generating and quickchecking}

    The default quickcheck instance random addresses without constraint. We
    also provide several modules with more specific restrictions. Most of
    these are in {!Address_gen}, but we expose their common ancestor,
    {!Quickcheck_generic}, here by necessity. *)

(** Generates random addresses, parametrised on a given lvalue generator. *)

  C4f_utils.My_quickcheck.S_with_sexp with type t = t

val eval_on_env : t -> env:Env.t -> Constant.t Or_error.t
(** [eval_on_env address ~env] tries to evaluate an address [lv] against the
    known-value tracking of an environment [env]. Currently, it supports only
    scalars; it rejects any ref or deref addresses. *)
