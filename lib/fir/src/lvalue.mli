(** FIR: lvalues.

    Lvalues, informally, represent a location to which we can store a value.
    In FIR, they are always either variable names, or dereferences of other
    lvalues.

    Not to be confused with the more general idea of 'addresses', which can
    either be lvalues or address-of modifications of other addresses, and are
    used where things expect pointers. *)

(* Needed because Base shadows it: *)
module Ty = Type

open Base
open Import

(** Type of lvalues. *)
type t = Variable of Common.C_id.t | Deref of t
[@@deriving sexp, accessors, compare, equal, quickcheck]

(** Note that the default quickcheck instance generates random lvalues
    without constraint. *)

(** {1 Constructors} *)

val of_variable_str_exn : string -> t
(** [of_variable_str_exn vs] tries to construct an lvalue over a variable
    whose name is the string [vs]. It fails with an exception if [vs] is an
    invalid C identifier. This function is for use mainly in testing, and
    shouldn't be used on user-supplied C code. *)

val un_deref : t -> t Or_error.t
(** [un_deref lvalue] tries to remove one layer of dereferencing from
    [lvalue]. It fails if [lvalue] is already a variable type. *)

val on_value_of_typed_id : Ty.t C4f_common.C_named.t -> t
(** [on_value_of_typed_id tid] constructs an lvalue with underlying variable
    [name tid] and the right level of indirection to convert from a variable
    of type [value tid] to a primitive value.

    For example, if [value tid] is a pointer type, the lvalue will become a
    dereference. *)

(** {1 Getters and accessors} *)

val reduce :
  t -> variable:(C4f_common.C_id.t -> 'a) -> deref:('a -> 'a) -> 'a
(** [reduce lvalue ~variable ~deref] applies [variable] on the underlying
    variable of [lvalue], then recursively applies [deref] to the result for
    each layer of indirection in the lvalue. *)

val is_deref : t -> bool
(** [is_deref lvalue] returns [true] if [lvalue] is a dereference of another
    [lvalue], and [false] otherwise. *)

(** {2 Safe getters}

    These getters return an error if the address isn't in the right shape. *)

val as_variable : t -> C4f_common.C_id.t Or_error.t
(** [as_variable lv] returns [lv], then returns it as a variable ID if it is
    one, or an error otherwise. *)

(** We can get to the variable name inside an lvalue. *)
include Types.S_has_underlying_variable with type t := t

(** Type-checking for lvalues. *)
include Types.S_type_checkable with type t := t

(** {1 Generating random lvalues}

    The default quickcheck instance random lvalues without constraint. We
    also provide several modules with more specific restrictions. Most of
    these are in {!Lvalue_gen}, but we expose their common ancestor,
    {!Quickcheck_generic}, here by necessity. *)

(** Generates random lvalues, parametrised on a given identifier generator. *)
module Quickcheck_generic
    (_ : C4f_utils.My_quickcheck.S_with_sexp
            with type t := C4f_common.C_id.t) : sig
  type nonrec t = t [@@deriving sexp_of, quickcheck]
