(** Evaluating expressions.

    This module provides a rundimentary expression evaluator for FIR
    expressions. This evaluator assumes that we can model the environment as
    a {!Heap}, which is quite simplistic in the face of weak memory. *)

val as_constant : Expression.t -> env:Heap.t -> Constant.t Or_error.t
(** [as_constant expr ~env] evaluates expression [expr] in the context of the
    abstract environment (store/heap) model [env], returning a constant if
    the evaluation succeeded or an error otherwise. *)
