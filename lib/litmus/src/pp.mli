(** Generalised pretty-printer for Litmus tests

    This pretty-printer assumes that threads are laid out vertically, and is
    not suitable for assembly-style Litmus tests that lay out in tables.

    Specialisations of Litmus tests for specific languages will often provide
    a specialised form of {!pp}. *)
