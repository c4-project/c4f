(** Support for evaluating {{!Postcondition.t} postconditions}.

    To be able to check whether a state set obeys a Litmus postcondition, we
    need to be able to evaluate the postcondition in the context of the state
    set. This module provides support for doing so. *)

(** {1 Abstract data type of postcondition results} *)

module Result : sig
  (** Opaque type of postcondition evaluations. *)
  type 'a t [@@deriving yojson]

  val truth : 'a t -> bool
  (** [truth e] gets [e]'s truth value. *)

  val witnesses : 'a t -> 'a list
  (** [witnesses e] gets the witnesses of whichever postcondition was
      evaluated (the items for which the predicate was true). *)

  val counter_examples : 'a t -> 'a list
  (** [counter_examples e] gets the counter-examples of whichever
      postcondition was evaluated (the items for which the predicate was
      false). *)
end

(** {1 Evaluating parts of postconditions} *)

val eval_pred :
  'const Predicate.t -> elt:('const Predicate.Element.t -> bool) -> bool
(** [eval_pred pred ~elt] evaluates a Litmus postcondition predicate,
    applying [elt] to check the truth of each predicate element. *)

val eval_quantifier :
     Postcondition.Quantifier.t
  -> f:('a -> bool)
  -> subjects:'a list
  -> 'a Result.t
(** [on_list q ~f ~subject] returns the result of evaluating [f] over the
    subjects in [subjects], where the truth value is determined by the
    quantifier [q] (for example, it will behave as [List.exists] if [q] is
    [Exists], and [List.for_all] if [q] is [For_all]). *)

val eval :
     'const Postcondition.t
  -> elt:('a -> 'const Predicate.Element.t -> bool)
  -> subjects:'a list
  -> 'a Result.t
(** [eval post ~elt ~subjects] evaluates a Litmus postcondition, against a
    list of subjects [subjects], applying [elt] to check the truth of each
    predicate element against a particular element. It returns the result as
    an {!Evaluation.t}. *)
