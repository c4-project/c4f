  -> ('ak, 'av, 'aw) Map.t
  -> f:(key:'ak -> data:'av -> 'bk * 'bv)
  -> ('bk, 'bv, 'bw) Map.t Or_error.t
(** [map_with_keys cmp map ~f] maps [f] across the keys and values of [f],
    then tries to reconstitute a map from the result. *)

val find_or_error :
     ?sexp_of_key:('k -> Sexp.t)
  -> ?map_name:string
  -> ('k, 'v, 'w) Map.t
  -> 'k
  -> 'v Or_error.t
(** [find_or_error ?sexp_of_key ?map_name map key] behaves like
    [find map key], but, instead of returning [None] on failure, returns an
    [Or_error] error. By passing [sexp_of_key], one can add the key to the
    returned error; by passing [map_name], one can customise the name given
    to the map in the error. *)

val merge_with_overlap :
     ('k, 'v, 'w) Map.t list
  -> compare:('v -> 'v -> int)
  -> ('k, 'v, 'w) Map.t Or_error.t
(** [merge_with_overlap maps ~compare] merges [maps] into a single map,
    permitting overlap between two maps' entries where [compare] returns
    equality for the entries' values. It fails if there is not at least one
    map in [maps], or if two maps map the same key to different values. *)
