(** Signature that file-system modules should implement.

    This signature exists to help mock up file-system operations in tests: we
    can pass in a mock implementation of [S] that doesn't actually consult
    the file system. *)

      handling, filtering, and path sorting using [compare] (which, by

      or indeterminate, and applies [on_absent] if it doesn't exist. *)

  val check_is_file :

  (** [check_is_file ?on_absent path] checks to see if [path] is a file. If
      so, it returns [()]. If not, it returns an error if [path] is a file or
      indeterminate, and applies [on_absent] if it doesn't exist. *)

  (** [mkdir path] tries to make a directory at path [path]. If [path] exists
      and is a directory, it does nothing. If [path] exists but is a file, or
      another error occurred, it returns an error message. *)
