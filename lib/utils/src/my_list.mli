(** [find_at_most_one ?item_name items ~f ~on_empty] tries to find an item in

    one exists; [on_empty] if none exist, and an error otherwise. *)

val find_one_opt :

(** [find_one_opt ?item_name items ~f] tries to find an item in [items] for

    one exists, [None] if none exist, and an error otherwise. *)

module Random : sig
  val index : _ list -> random:Splittable_random.State.t -> int option
  (** [index xs ~random] returns [None] if [xs] is empty, and [Some i], where
      [i] is a random number generated with [random] between [0] and
      [length xs] exclusive, otherwise. *)

  val span : _ list -> random:Splittable_random.State.t -> Span.t option
  (** [index xs ~random] returns [None] if [xs] is empty, otherwise
      [Some {pos; len}], where [pos] is a random index generated with
      [random] between [0] and [length xs] exclusive and [len] is a random
      length generated with [random] between [0] and the [length] of the
      sub-list after [pos]. *)

  val item : 'a list -> random:Splittable_random.State.t -> 'a option
  (** [item xs ~random] behaves like Base's [List.random_element], but uses a
      splittable RNG for compatibility with Quickcheck etc. *)

(** {1 Manipulating lists} *)

val merge_preserving_order :
  ('a -> 'a -> bool) -> 'a list -> 'a list -> 'a list
(** [merge_preserving_order equal l r] merges [l] and [r] in such a way that:

    - if [l] and [r] are duplicate-free, so is the result;
    - the order of the elements is the same as in [l] and [r], preferring the
      order in [r] if there is a clash.

    This merge is the same as that described in
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36128200. *)

val split_or_error : 'a list -> int -> ('a list * 'a list) Or_error.t
(** [split_or_error xs n] behaves like [split xs n], but returns an error if
    [n] is negative or greater than the length of the list. *)

val splice :
     'a list
  -> span:Span.t
  -> replace_f:('a list -> 'a list)
  -> 'a list Or_error.t
(** [splice xs ~span ~replace_f] replaces the part of [xs] denoted by [pos]
    and [len] with its image in [replace_f]. It returns an error if [pos] is
    out of bounds, or the list from [pos] onwards is shorter than [len]. *)

val try_splice :
     'a list
  -> span:Span.t
  -> replace_f:('a list -> 'a list Or_error.t)
  -> 'a list Or_error.t
(** [try_splice xs ~span ~replace_f] behaves as {!splice}, but accepts a
    [replace_f] that can fail. *)

val map_sub : 'a list -> span:Span.t -> f:('a -> 'a) -> 'a list Or_error.t
(** [map_sub xs ~span ~f] maps [f] over the part of [xs] denoted by [pos] and
    [len]. *)

val try_map_sub :
  'a list -> span:Span.t -> f:('a -> 'a Or_error.t) -> 'a list Or_error.t
(** [try_map_sub xs ~span ~f] maps [f] over the part of [xs] denoted by [pos]
    and [len]. *)

val eval_guards : (bool * (unit -> 'a)) list -> 'a list
(** [eval_guards xs] filters [xs] to those entries [(b, f)] for which [b] is
    true, and then maps to [f ()] for each. It is useful for presenting to
    quickcheck [union] generators a list of sub-generators that may or may
    not be viable at run-time depending on a Boolean flag. *)

(** {2 Guarding a function based on the emptiness of a list}

    These functions don't distinguish in the type system between a non-empty
    list and a normal list; this behaviour may change eventually. *)

val guard_if_empty_opt : 'a list -> f:('a list -> 'b option) -> 'b option
(** [guard_if_empty_opt xs f] evaluates to [f xs] if [xs] is non-empty, and
    [None] otherwise. *)

val guard_if_empty : 'a list -> f:('a list -> 'b) -> 'b option
(** [guard_if_empty xs f] evaluates to [Some (f xs)] if [xs] is non-empty,
    and [None] otherwise. *)
