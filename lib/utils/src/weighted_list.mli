(** Weighted lists

    Weighted lists are lists in which each item has an attached non-negative
    integer weight. This weight is then used when selecting random items from
    the list: an item of weight [2*n] is twice as likely to be selected over
    an item of weight [n].

    This is similar in spirit to Core_extended's [Sampler], but slightly
    different in execution. *)

val from_alist : ('a, int) List.Assoc.t -> 'a t Or_error.t
(** [from_alist alist] tries to convert the associative list [alist], which
    maps values to their weights, to a weighted list. It fails if [alist] is
    empty, or if any weight is negative (note that weights may be zero). *)

(** {1 Operations} *)

val adjust_weights : 'a t -> f:('a -> int -> int) -> 'a t Or_error.t
(** [adjust_weights wl ~f] maps [f] over every weight in [table], providing
    the weighted item for context. It fails if any invocation of [f] tries to
    return a negative weight (note that weights may be zero). *)

val find : 'a t -> f:('a -> bool) -> 'a option
(** [find wl ~f] finds the first item in [wl] for which [f] is true, if any. *)

val fold : 'a t -> f:('b -> 'a -> int -> 'b) -> init:'b -> 'b
(** [fold wl ~f ~init] folds [f] over every row in [wl], starting at [init]. *)

val iter : 'a t -> f:('a -> int -> unit) -> unit
(** [iter wl ~f ~init] applies side-effectful function [f] to every row in
    [wl]. *)

(** {1 Sampling} *)

val sample : 'a t -> random:Splittable_random.State.t -> 'a option
(** [sample wl ~random] converts [wl] to a cumulative list, then samples it
    according to the random number generator [random]. It fails if the
    conversion fails.

    If you sample from the same list often, consider converting it to a
    cumulative list once, then sampling that directly. *)

val sample_gen_exn : 'a t -> 'a Base_quickcheck.Generator.t
(** [sample_gen_exn wl] is [sample], but wrapped up as a Quickcheck generator
    that raises exceptions on failure. *)

(** Type of weighted lists that have been re-arranged to list weights
    cumulatively. *)

  val of_weighted_list : 'a w -> 'a t option
  (** [of_weighted_list wl] converts [wl] to a cumulative list. It fails if
      there are no items in [wl] with a nonzero weight. *)

  val sample : 'a t -> random:Splittable_random.State.t -> 'a
  (** [sample cl ~random] samples the cumulative list [cl] according to the
