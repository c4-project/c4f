(** Type of input into a filter or similar construct.

    This module contains a type that describes how a filter should receive
    its input---for example, from a local file, or standard input. *)

open Base
open Stdio

(** Opaque type of inputs. *)
type t

(** @inline *)
include Io_types.Common with type t := t

(** {2 Constructing an input} *)

val file : Fpath.t -> t
(** [file fname] creates an input source for a given filename. *)

val stdin : ?file_type:string -> unit -> t
(** [stdin] is the standard input source.

    If [file_type] is given, it is reported as the file type of standard
    input, in the same way as the extension of a [file]. *)

(** {2 Querying an input} *)

val file_type : t -> string option
(** [file_type src] gets the file type of [src]. This is the file extension
    for [file]s, and the optional provided extension otherwise. *)

(** {2 Consuming an input} *)

val with_input : t -> f:(In_channel.t -> 'a Or_error.t) -> 'a Or_error.t
(** [with_input i ~f] runs [f] connected to the input channel pointed to by
    [i]. *)
