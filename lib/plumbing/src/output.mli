(** Type of output into a filter or similar construct.

    This module contains a type that describes how a filter should dispose of
    its output---for example, into a local file, or on standard output. *)

(** Opaque type of outputs. *)

(** {1 Constructing an output} *)

val file : Fpath.t -> t
(** [file fname] creates an output sink for a given filename. *)

val stdout : t
(** [stdout] is the standard output sink. *)

val temp_file : prefix:string -> ext:string -> Fpath.t
(** [temp_file ~prefix ~ext] creates a path for a temporary file with the
    given prefix and extension. *)

val temp : prefix:string -> ext:string -> t
(** [temp ~prefix ~ext] creates an output sink for a temporary file with the
    given prefix and extension. *)

val as_input : t -> Input.t Or_error.t
(** [as_input o] tries to get an {{!Input.t} input} pointing to the same data
    as [o]. *)

val with_opt : t option -> f:(t -> unit Or_error.t) -> unit Or_error.t
(** [with_opt o ~f] does nothing if [o] is None, and applies [f] if [o] is
    [Some o']. *)

val with_output : t -> f:(Out_channel.t -> 'a Or_error.t) -> 'a Or_error.t
(** [with_output o ~f] runs [f] connected to the output channel pointed to by
    [o]. *)
