(** Actions that introduce, or rearrange, if statements. *)

(** {1 Actions that surround statements in if statements}

    The general idea of such a generator is that it takes:

    - a condition expression generator in the form of an action payload;
    - a mapping from an existing statement list to the 'true' block of the
      statement generator;
    - a similar mapping to the 'false' block. *)
module Surround : sig
  (** Each if statement generator has this type. *)
  module type S =
    C4f_fuzz.Action_types.S
      with type Payload.t = C4f_fuzz.Payload_impl.Cond_pathed.t

  (** Generates if statements where the expression is arbitrary and both
      blocks contain the original statement span. *)
  module Duplicate : S

  (** Generates if statements where the expression is a tautology, the first
      block contains the original statement span, and the second block is an
      empty dead-code block. *)
  module Tautology : S
end

module Transform : sig
  (** Basic transform generators have this type. *)
  module type S =
    C4f_fuzz.Action_types.S with type Payload.t = C4f_fuzz.Path.With_meta.t

  (** Inverts existing if statements. *)
  module Invert : S
