open Import

(** Type of modules that set various flags characterising a storelike
    action's behaviour. *)
module type Flags = sig
  val erase_known_values : bool
  (** [erase_known_values] is a flag that, when true, causes the action to
      erase the known value when finished. *)

  val execute_multi_safe : [`Always | `Never | `If_no_cycles]
  (** [execute_multi_safe] is a 3-way flag that governs whether the storelike
      action is safe to execute multiple times. *)
end

(** Type of modules that describe a storelike statement and how to generate
    and manipulate it. *)
module type Basic = sig
  val readme_preamble : string list
  (** [readme_preamble] is the part of the action readme specific to this
      form of the storelike action. *)

  val dst_type : Fir.Type.Basic.t
  (** [dst_type] is the value type of the destination. *)

  val path_filter : Fuzz.Path_filter.t
  (** [path_filter] is the filter to apply on statement insertion paths
      before considering them for the atomic store. *)

  val extra_dst_restrictions : (Fuzz.Var.Record.t -> bool) list
  (** [extra_dst_restrictions] is a list of additional restrictions to place
      on the destination variables (for example, 'must not have
      dependencies'). *)

  (** Flags. *)
  module Flags : Flags

  (** Type of storelike statements. *)
  type t [@@deriving sexp]

    -> dst:Fir.Env.t
    -> vars:C4f_fuzz.Var.Map.t
    -> tid:int
    -> t Base_quickcheck.Generator.t
  (** [gen ~src ~dst ~vars ~tid] returns a quickcheck instance for atomic
      stores given source and destination variable environments [src] and
      [dst], a variable map [vars] for fresh variable generation, and the
      target thread ID [tid]. *)

  val new_local_cap : int
  (** [new_local_cap] is the maximum number of new locals that will be added
      for this storelike; the action will refuse to fire if adding this
      amount exceeds the variable cap. *)

  val new_locals : t -> Fir.Initialiser.t C4f_common.C_named.Alist.t
  (** [new_locals s] gets a list of any new local variables created for this
      storelike, which should be registered and added to both the thread's
      decls and the state. *)

  val dst_ids : t -> C4f_common.C_id.t list
  (** [dst_exprs s] gets a list of any (unscoped) destination C identifiers
      used in this storelike. *)

  val src_exprs : t -> Fir.Expression.t list
  (** [src_exprs s] gets a list of any source expressions used in this
      storelike. *)

  val to_stms : t -> meta:Fuzz.Metadata.t -> Fuzz.Subject.Statement.t list
  (** [to_stms s ~meta] lifts a storelike into a list of statements, and
      should apply [meta] to each. *)
